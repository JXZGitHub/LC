        Initially, define 'low' and 'high' as the lowest value and highest value in matrix. then define mid as the middle value between the 2 (may not be a real value in matrix).

        Then using 'right boundary' binary search, count how many items are <= that mid value, and depending on count
        versus k, shrink the range of low and high by either making low = mid+1 or make high=mid.

        Invariant is that kth largest number is always within [low,high], so eventually low becomes > high or high<low,
        and when loop exists, low is the kth largest.
