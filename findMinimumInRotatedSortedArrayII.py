        After rotation, array consists of the first increasing segment, and 2nd increasing segment.
        First segment has every element bigger than those in the 2nd increasing segment.

        Binary Search: first check if the array is rotated (first is < last means it's NOT rotated anymore),
        if not, then just reurn first element.

        If it's rotated, determine if the minimum is in the 1st increasing segment or 2nd increasing segment.

        To deal with DUPLICATES:
        If the current array's first element = last element, then shift the first index to the right by 1.
