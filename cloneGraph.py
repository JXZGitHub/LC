        Similar Solution to 'Copy Linked List with Random Pointer':
        Use BFS (queue) to reach every neighbor starting from node,
        then use a dictionary to store key as the original node,
        value as a cloned node. Then, for every neighbor of the each node off the queue, populate the v
        (which is the cloned node)'s neighbors with WHATEVER cloned node that each neighbor's points to according to the dict.

        When each neihgbor of node is traversed,
        skip any that has already been placed in the dictionary to avoid cycles.

        Time: O(V+E), V is #number of nodes, e is number of edges:
        Space: O(V)
